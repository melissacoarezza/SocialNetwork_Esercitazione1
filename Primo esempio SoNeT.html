    <article>In 2008 the Blender Foundation made Big Buck Bunny and released all the files under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license for everyone to learn from and play with. Originally the movie was only rendered for standard HD screens. Now it has been re-rendered in cinema quality 4k HDRI, 60 fps, 3D stereo. Not only is there now a very high quality version of BBB to give back to the community, it has been a perfect opportunity to improve the online renderfarm BURP while making it; and to show that it is actually possible.</article>
